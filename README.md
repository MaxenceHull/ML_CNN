# ML_CNN
- This Jupyter Notebook has been realized during the course IFT6135 at the Université de Montréal
- We compared different techniques in a convolutional neural network
 - Different optimizers such as SGD, RMSprop ...
 - Different regularizers such as L2 and Dropout
- We made an analysis of our final model studying features maps
